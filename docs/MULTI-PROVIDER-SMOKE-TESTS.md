# Multi-provider smoke tests

Manual checks for cross-provider sub-agents: a named definition in
`~/.plank/agents/*.md` running on a different engine than the main agent.

`multi-provider-tests/` in this repo is a runnable starting point for the two
main configurations: two prepared session directories plus `test-regolo.sh`,
which checks the provider side over curl before plank is involved. It needs only
`REGOLO_API_KEY`. What follows is the fuller matrix.

Everything here is **manual and needs real credentials**. The unit suite covers
the logic against `EchoEngine` and stubs with no network
(`cargo test --lib` — see `agents::`, `sysprompt::`, and the `fanout_*` /
`alt_engine` tests in `ui::`). What it cannot cover is a real provider's wire
format, real latency, real rate limits, and whether the model actually chooses
to delegate. That is what these are for.

## What is and isn't supported

| Main engine | Sub-agent engine | Supported |
|---|---|---|
| local ds4 | local ds4 (no `provider:`, or `provider: local`) | yes — the pre-existing behaviour |
| local ds4 | remote provider (`provider:` set) | **yes — the point of this feature** |
| remote provider | same or another remote provider | yes |
| remote provider | local ds4 (`provider: local`) | yes — see below |
| remote provider | no `provider:` at all | yes, but it runs on the **remote** engine |

### "Remote main, local sub-agent": `provider: local`

`provider: local` names the ds4 engine specifically. When the main agent is a
provider and any visible definition asks for it, `make_engine` loads the local
engine *alongside* the provider one and hands it to the `Agent`, which holds it in
the same cache as any other alternate engine (`EngineKey::Local`). The sidechain
then runs on the local model while the main conversation stays on the provider.

Two consequences worth knowing before you use it:

- **It costs the full local residency.** The default quant needs ~82 GB and only
  one process can hold it (`require_min_ram` plus the single-instance lock), so a
  provider session with a `provider: local` definition is as heavy to start as a
  local session. The load happens at startup, deliberately: a missing model or
  insufficient RAM fails before the prompt rather than mid-turn.
- **It is opt-in, and only that spelling.** Omitting `provider:` still means "the
  parent's engine", which under `--provider` is the remote model. The two used to
  be spelled the same way; they are not the same intention, and only the explicit
  one triggers the extra load.

Under a *local* main agent, `provider: local` is not an override at all — the
parent already is the local engine, so the sidechain runs on it and no second
engine is held.

If the local engine is absent (a build without the ds4 engine, or a session that
started before the definition existed), dispatching such a definition reports
`engine unavailable: no local engine in this session` rather than silently running
on the remote model the definition declined.

## Setup

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # provider default
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ALT=sk-ant-...    # a second key, for test 5
mkdir -p ~/.plank/agents
```

`~/.plank/agents/remote-reviewer.md`

```markdown
---
name: remote-reviewer
description: Reviews a diff for correctness and missed edge cases
provider: anthropic
model: claude-opus-5
---
Review what you are given for defects you can demonstrate. For each one, give
the input that triggers it and the wrong output. Skip style opinions. Finish
with a short report.
```

`~/.plank/agents/local-helper.md` — no `provider:`, so it runs on the parent
engine:

```markdown
---
name: local-helper
description: Summarises how a module works
---
Answer concisely from the code you read. Finish with a short report.
```

---

## 1. Registration and visibility

**Run:** `/agent`

**Expect:**

```
Agents (dispatch with /subagent:<name> <task>):
  local-helper — Summarises how a module works
  remote-reviewer — Reviews a diff for correctness and missed edge cases [anthropic claude-opus-5]

Model may pick these on its own: yes (/config agents.autoRoute), up to 4 at once (/config agents.maxParallel).
```

- The engine label appears only on `remote-reviewer`.
- No `(no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)` marker, since the key is set.

**Then** unset the key in a fresh shell and re-run: the marker appears and names
the variable. Definitions stay listed — being unusable hides a definition from
the *model*, not from you.

## 2. Explicit dispatch to a remote definition

**Run:** `/subagent:remote-reviewer summarise what src/agents.rs does`

**Expect:**
- A `[sub-agent: remote-reviewer — ← for agents]` line.
- A roster row for `remote-reviewer` below the status bar, ticking; `←` then
  Enter expands it, and its text reads like the remote model, not the local one.
- Only the framed report enters the main conversation.
- The footer's engine-origin indicator still shows the **main** engine
  afterwards — the swap was restored.

**Watch for:** any sign the sidechain ran on the local model (the local model has
a recognisable voice, and a local run is far slower to first token on a cold KV).

## 3. Tools work inside a remote sidechain

This is the one most likely to break silently, because a provider engine given a
flat prompt receives an empty tool list.

**Run:** `/subagent:remote-reviewer count the test functions in src/agents.rs by reading the file`

**Expect:** the sub-agent actually calls `read` (or `search`), and its report
cites a real number. If it instead says it cannot access files, the structured
prompt or tool registry is not reaching it — check
`build_structured_for`.

## 4. The model routes on its own

**Run:** a prompt that invites delegation without naming an agent:

> fix the off-by-one in `<some file>`, then have the change reviewed

**Expect:** the model calls `agent` with `name: "remote-reviewer"` of its own
accord.

**Then** run `/config agents.autoRoute false` and repeat. Expect the model to
stop selecting definitions and either do the work itself or delegate to a
general-purpose sub-agent — while `/subagent:remote-reviewer ...` still works.
Restore with `/config agents.autoRoute true`.

**Also try** a plausible-but-wrong name by asking for "the code-reviewer agent".
A near-miss must produce a `note: no agent named '…'` line plus a real report,
never a bare tool error.

## 5. Two keys, two accounts

Add `~/.plank/agents/alt-reviewer.md` — identical to `remote-reviewer` except:

```markdown
name: alt-reviewer
api-key-env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ALT
```

**Run:** `/subagent:remote-reviewer …` then `/subagent:alt-reviewer …` in one
session.

**Expect:** both succeed. They differ only in key variable, so they must get
*separate* cached engines — if they shared one, the second would run on the
first's credentials. Check the provider dashboards for both keys and confirm
each shows exactly one request's worth of usage.

**Then** unset `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ALT` and retry `alt-reviewer`: expect
`Tool error: agent 'alt-reviewer' engine unavailable: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ALT is
not set`, naming *that* variable rather than the provider default, and with no
sidechain started.

## 6. Parallel fan-out

Add a second and third remote definition (`remote-a`, `remote-b`, `remote-c`),
each with a `provider:`/`model:`, then ask for work that splits cleanly:

> review src/agents.rs, src/settings.rs and src/engine.rs — use a separate
> sub-agent for each

**Expect:**
- A single `[sub-agents: remote-a, remote-b, remote-c — ← for agents]` line,
  plural, and three roster rows ticking together.
- Wall-clock close to the *slowest* sub-agent, not the sum. Time it — this is the
  only check that proves concurrency rather than fast serial execution.
- Reports appear in the order the model requested them, regardless of which
  finished first.
- Output is **buffered**: nothing streams during the fan-out, then each
  sub-agent's block appears labelled, in call order. This is by design; the pane
  holds one log, so live interleaving would be unreadable.

**Then** `/config agents.maxParallel 1` and repeat: expect the same reports,
serially, taking roughly the sum of the individual times.

**Then** ask for two reviews *and* a file read in the same turn. Expect no
fan-out — a mixed block stays serial so side effects keep their order.

## 7. Remote main agent

**Run:** `plank --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-5`

**Expect:**
- `/agent` lists every definition as before.
- `/subagent:remote-reviewer …` works (remote main → remote sub-agent).
- `/subagent:local-helper …` **also works, but runs on the remote provider** — it
  has no `provider:`, so it inherits the parent engine. Confirm it is not
  silently doing nothing, and confirm the billing lands on the main key.

### 7b. A local sub-agent under a remote main agent

Add `~/.plank/agents/cheap-local.md`:

```markdown
---
name: cheap-local
description: Grep-and-summarise work that does not need the big model
provider: local
---
Answer from the files you read. Finish with a short report.
```

**Run:** `plank --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-5` again.

**Expect:**
- A startup line saying a sub-agent definition asked for the local engine, then
  the usual model load — the provider session now pays the local load too.
- `/agent` shows `cheap-local — … [local]`, with no key marker.
- `/subagent:cheap-local summarise src/agents.rs` runs on the **local** model:
  recognisably the local voice, and slow to first token on a cold KV.
- The footer's engine-origin indicator still shows the provider afterwards — the
  swap was restored.
- `/usage` attributes nothing to the provider for that dispatch.

**Then** remove the definition and restart: no local load, no startup line. The
cost is paid only when something asks for it.

## 8. Failure and interruption

| Do this | Expect |
|---|---|
| Set `model:` to a name the provider does not know | A tool error from the provider; the main session keeps working afterwards |
| Set `base-url:` to an unreachable host | A tool error after the retry budget; the main session survives |
| `ctrl+c` during a remote sidechain | The turn ends; the next turn works normally and the footer shows the main engine |
| `ctrl+c` during a fan-out | Same; partial reports for whatever finished |
| Revoke the key mid-session, then dispatch again | `engine unavailable: <VAR> is not set`, with no sidechain started |

After every one of these, `/subagent:remote-reviewer ok` must still work. A
leaked engine swap would leave the whole session pointed at the wrong engine,
which is the worst failure this design can produce and the thing most worth
re-checking by hand.

### Two `claude-opus-5` behaviours worth provoking

Neither is a plank bug, and neither shows up on a happy-path run — but both
surface through the provider path as something that *looks* like a plank defect.

**A refusal is an HTTP 200, not an error.** The model's safety classifiers can
decline a request, returning success with `stop_reason: "refusal"`, a
`stop_details` category, and `content` that is empty (declined before any output)
or partial (declined mid-stream). A request touching security or life-sciences
topics is the way to provoke one; benign adjacent work sometimes trips them,
which is exactly why this matters. Ask the sub-agent to review something
security-shaped and check what comes back: a clear tool error naming the refusal
is fine, an empty report or a parse failure is not — that means the response path
reads `content` without checking `stop_reason` first.

**Thinking is on by default and shares the `max_tokens` budget.** Unlike
Opus 4.8/4.7, omitting the `thinking` parameter on `claude-opus-5` runs adaptive
thinking, and `max_tokens` caps thinking *plus* response text together. Give a
definition a deliberately small `ctx:` and a task needing a long answer; if the
report arrives truncated mid-sentence, the budget is being consumed by thinking.
Worth knowing before blaming the sidechain loop.

## 9. Cache and cost sanity

- Dispatch the same definition three times in one session. The context-window
  probe should happen **once**; watch for a single extra request beyond the three
  generations on the provider side.
- A clean-room sidechain must send only the framed task, never the parent
  conversation. Check the provider's request logs (or a proxy) and confirm the
  parent transcript does not appear. This is a privacy property, not just a cost
  one.
- Compare token counts for a long main conversation: a remote sub-agent's input
  should stay small and roughly constant as the parent conversation grows.

## 10. Regression checks after any change here

```sh
cargo test --lib            # 1235 tests, no model or network
cargo test --test c_parity  # must pass with fixtures untouched
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

`tests/fixtures/` must show no diff. With an empty roster both schema paths emit
byte-identical output to the pre-roster build, which is what keeps the parity
fixtures valid; if they change, the fix belongs in the code, not in
`PLANK_REGEN_FIXTURES=1`.
