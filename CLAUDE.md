# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What plank is

A Rust port of the `ds4_agent` C reference (an interactive coding agent for the DeepSeek V4 Flash model), ported functionality-by-functionality — each C section became an idiomatic Rust module with its own tests. The C reference lives in the `refs/ds4` git submodule and is the **source of truth for wire formats and prompt text**: tool output framing, the DSML tool-call syntax, and the system prompt must stay byte-for-byte identical to the C, because that's what the model was trained on. `tests/c_parity.rs` enforces this against committed fixtures (and against the C source when the submodule is present); regenerate fixtures with `PLANK_REGEN_FIXTURES=1 cargo test`. Hard-won parity and tooling gotchas are cataloged in `FINDINGS.md` — check it before re-deriving a quirk, and add to it when you pin down a new one. Beware: a `\`-continued Rust string literal strips the next line's leading whitespace — never use continued literals for model-facing text with indentation. macOS only for real inference (Metal).

## Commands

```sh
cargo build                 # debug build (builds the C engine via build.rs when refs/ds4 is present)
cargo test --lib            # unit tests — no model needed, pure logic + EchoEngine
cargo test --lib <name>     # single test by substring filter
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # CI gate; pedantic + perf lints are warn-by-default in Cargo.toml but -D warnings makes them fail
```

The pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt` and the clippy command above (with `-D warnings`, same as CI); fix warnings rather than allowing them. Note clippy only re-lints crates it recompiles, so a cached "clean" run can miss warnings in untouched files — CI compiles fresh, so trust the hook/CI over an incremental local run.

- **With the `refs/ds4` submodule present** (macOS): `build.rs` compiles `libds4core.a`, links Foundation/Metal, and emits the `ds4_engine` cfg. Real inference needs a GGUF model (see `download_model.sh` in `refs/ds4`).
- **Without it**: plank still builds and tests, using only the `EchoEngine` stub — this is the normal dev/CI path. Code touching the native engine must be gated with `#[cfg(ds4_engine)]`.

## Architecture

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full picture (layer diagram, turn lifecycle, module reference). The essentials:

- **Engine trait boundary** (`engine.rs`): all inference sits behind `Engine` (`generate`, `warm_reset`/`warm_append`/`warm_sync`, `get_kv`/`set_kv`, `count_tokens`, `ctx_size`). `ds4engine.rs` + `ffi.rs` are the real Metal-backed implementation (cfg-gated); `EchoEngine` is the always-available stub that keeps the whole app runnable.
- **Agent core** (`ui.rs`): the `Agent` struct owns engine, session, tools, and system prompt; `run_turn`/`tui_turn` drive the generate → dispatch tools → feed results loop until a generation emits no tool calls. Slash commands are handled here, in **two parallel paths** (plain stdout REPL and Ratatui TUI) — a change to one usually needs the mirror change in the other.
- **Streaming display** (`viz.rs` → `render.rs`/`tui.rs`, `dsml.rs`): model bytes flow through `viz::StreamRenderer` (detects DSML tool calls, emits banners, splits visible vs. thinking text) into a swappable `RenderSink` — ANSI stdout or the Ratatui `OutputLog`. `dsml.rs` is the strict parser producing executable `ToolCall`s.
- **Tools** (`tools/`): `dispatch` mirrors the C tool table — files, edit (with `[upto]` anchoring), bash (sync + async jobs), web, plus the MCP stdio client (`mcp.rs`, hierarchical `~/.plank/.mcp.json` + `./.mcp.json` configs).
- **Sessions & context** (`session.rs`, `compact.rs`, `sysprompt.rs`, `context.rs`): transcript persistence under `~/.plank/kvcache` with SHA-1 identities (`<id>.kv` transcripts alongside `<stem>.kv_raw` KV blobs, each with an advisory `<stem>.json` metadata sidecar carrying lineage, usage counters and pin state, swept at startup by a TTL plus byte-budget GC), compaction (durable summary + verbatim tail), system prompt text, and session-start context (git status, AGENTS.md discovery, date).
- **Plugins** (`plugins.rs`): a plugin is a directory bundling skills, agents, templates, hooks, an `.mcp.json` and a `settings.json`, activated from `~/.plank/plugins/dev/`, `./.plank/plugins/`, or `--plugin-dir`. Both the plank (`.plank-plugin/plugin.json`, `templates/`, `hooks.json`) and Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `commands/`, `hooks/hooks.json`) spellings are accepted. Contributions merge into the existing loaders: a plugin entry is always addressable as `<plugin>:<name>` and keeps the bare name only when nothing else claims it. Plugin settings sit below `~/.plank/settings.json`, so a plugin can never override the user. A third scan root, `~/.plank/plugins/claude/`, holds plugins fetched from a git repository, a marketplace repository, or a `.tar.gz` (`claudeplugin.rs`) via `/install-claude-plugin <url|owner/repo> [name] [--force]`; installing rewrites `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to the install path because plank's hook runner injects no environment when it execs `/bin/sh`.
- **KV-cache discipline** (`docs/KV-CACHING.md` for the requirements-to-implementation rationale, `docs/KV-CACHE.md` for the layer-by-layer mechanics): `Ds4Engine` keeps one live session across turns so only the new suffix is prefilled; the system prompt has a fingerprinted disk snapshot (`sysprompt-<fp1>.kv_raw`). Reuse only genuinely matching token prefixes: a blob's embedded signature is the sole trust input, its sidecar is advisory, and a stale checkpoint is rebuilt rather than trusted. On top of that, `kvladder.rs` keeps up to 3 KV snapshots ("rungs", `<id>.rung-<n>.kv_raw`) at increasing transcript depths so micro-compaction's in-place tool-result rewrites can restore a rung that predates the edit and extend forward, instead of forcing a full re-prefill; `context.microcompact` (default `true`) disables micro-compaction entirely when off. The one rule that must never break: a rung is looked up under the fingerprint of the transcript *truncated to the rung's own recorded depth*, never the full current transcript — get it backwards and every rung misses forever, silently, while the feature looks fully wired up.
- **Front-end selection** (`main.rs`): TTY on both ends → Ratatui TUI; piped → plain line REPL; `--non-interactive` → headless stdin protocol. Slash commands with a pane, such as the interactive `/kvcache` cache browser, need a static text equivalent on the plain-stdout path (`/kvcache pin|unpin|rm|gc`).
