# 9. Extending plank

Five extension points, all discovered the same way: a global directory or file under `~/.plank/`, overlaid by a project-scoped one in the working directory, where the project version wins on a name collision.

| Extension | Global | Project |
|---|---|---|
| Skills | `~/.plank/skills/` | `./.plank/skills/` |
| Templates | `~/.plank/templates/` | `./.plank/templates/` |
| Subagents | `~/.plank/agents/*.md` | `./.plank/agents/*.md` |
| Hooks | `~/.plank/hooks.json` | `./.plank/hooks.json` |
| MCP servers | `~/.plank/.mcp.json` | `./.mcp.json` |

## Skills

A skill is a packaged procedure: a directory containing `SKILL.md`, with optional frontmatter followed by the prompt body.

```
~/.plank/skills/release/SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: release
description: Cut a release — bump, tag, changelog, publish
argument-hint: <version>
---

Cut a release for version $ARGUMENTS:

1. Bump the version in Cargo.toml
2. Update CHANGELOG.md from the commits since the last tag
3. Commit, tag, and push
```

Invoking `/release 2.8.0` splices the body — with `$ARGUMENTS` substituted — in as a preamble and runs a normal turn.

Skills are **both user- and model-invoked**: you can type `/release`, and the model can reach for the `skill` tool when a task matches one. `/skills` lists what is installed.

## Templates

A template is the lighter-weight sibling of a skill: one `*.md` file whose stem is the command name, with named holes instead of a single `$ARGUMENTS` splice.

```
~/.plank/templates/review.md
```

```markdown
---
description: Review a file against a specific concern
argument-hint: <path> <concern>
---

Review {{path}}, focusing specifically on {{concern}}.
```

Interpolation is deliberately minimal: `{{name}}` and nothing else. No conditionals, no expressions. `/templates` lists them, and built-in commands always win over a template of the same name.

**Skill or template?** A skill is a directory with a procedure the model may also choose on its own; a template is a file that saves you retyping a prompt shape.

## Subagents

A subagent runs a delegated task as a fork of the current conversation: the framed task is appended, a normal turn loop runs with tools, and afterwards the fork is truncated so **only the final report** enters your transcript. Because the fork shares the parent's prefix, it costs almost nothing to enter and is rolled back cleanly on the next real turn.

```
/subagent audit every unwrap() in src/ and report the risky ones
```

Beyond the built-in general-purpose subagent, define named ones as markdown files:

```
~/.plank/agents/reviewer.md
```

Each supplies extra instructions that frame the subagent's turn. Dispatch one by name with a colon on the command itself:

```
/subagent:reviewer check the diff on this branch
```

`/agent` lists them. The name is part of the command rather than the first word of the task, so a task that happens to start with a definition's name is never quietly reinterpreted as a persona — and because the name is explicit, one that does not exist is reported rather than silently falling back to the general-purpose subagent. While you type, the TUI colours the `:<name>` **green** when it resolves and **red** when it does not, so a typo shows up before you press Enter.

The model can delegate on its own with the `agent` tool. Delegation is bounded at one level — a subagent cannot itself delegate — which keeps a runaway from spawning a tree.

What comes back is the answer, not the deliberation: the report is stripped of the subagent's thinking before it enters your transcript, and the subagent is asked to state its conclusion once with the reason attached. Its reasoning is still there to read in the roster while it works.

While agents are running, the TUI lists them in a roster below the status bar — one row each, with the task, the clock and the token spend, and `←` then `Enter` to read any agent's output in full. See [The agent roster](03-the-interface.md#the-agent-roster).

When the subagent reports back, plank runs a turn on that report: delegated work comes back into the conversation and gets acted on, rather than sitting in the transcript until you type again.

### Giving a subagent its own worktree

Add `isolation: worktree` to a definition's frontmatter and each run of that subagent gets its own throwaway checkout, so several agents working at once cannot overwrite each other's edits:

```markdown
---
name: refactorer
description: Restructures code without touching the main checkout
isolation: worktree
---
```

The subagent is told where it is and to translate inherited paths accordingly. When it finishes, a worktree it left clean is removed; one holding changes is **kept**, and its path is reported back so you can review and merge it. Setting `worktree.isolateAgents` to `true` in `settings.json` turns this on for every subagent instead of one at a time. It is off by default: a checkout per agent is not free, and the work then has to be merged back.

### Running a subagent on a different engine

A definition can name its own engine, and then its sidechain runs there instead of on whatever the main agent uses:

```markdown
---
name: cheap-local
description: grep-and-summarise work that does not need the expensive model
provider: local
---
Be terse. Report findings, not process.
```

`provider: local` means the local ds4 engine specifically. Under a hosted main agent, plank loads it alongside the provider at startup — that is a real memory cost, and it says so before it loads, so only an explicit definition triggers it. A definition can equally point at a hosted provider (`provider: anthropic`, a model, and the environment variable holding the key); `/agent` lists each one's engine and tells you when its key variable is unset.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **A cross-engine sidechain is clean-room.** The parent transcript is hidden and only the framed task is sent, so a hosted subagent is never billed for your conversation and a local one never has to prefill it.
- **`/agent` and the status bar both show it.** Every engine in play is named in the bar, so you can see which one is working — see [The interface](03-the-interface.md#the-screen).

## Hooks

Hooks run your shell commands (or inject static prompts) at lifecycle points. Configuration is JSON, merged from `~/.plank/hooks.json` then `./.plank/hooks.json`, with both lists running.

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    { "matcher": "bash|edit",
      "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "check.sh", "timeout": 60 } ] }
  ]
}
```

### Events

| Event | Fires | Exit code 2 means |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | before a tool runs | block the tool; stderr becomes the model-visible error |
| `PostToolUse` | after a tool runs | append stderr to the model's observation |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | after a tool that failed | (carries the error) |
| `Stop` | as a turn concludes | feed stderr back and continue the turn (once per turn) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | every submitted prompt | may inject turn context |
| `SessionStart` | session begins (`startup`/`resume`/`clear`/`compact`) | may inject context |
| `SessionEnd` | session ends (with a reason) | — |
| `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` | around a compaction pass | may inject context; both carry `trigger` (`manual` for `/compact`, `auto` for a threshold pass) and `PostCompact` carries the summary. `PostCompact` does not fire for a pass that was interrupted or produced no summary, since no compaction happened |
| `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove` | plank needs a worktree made or destroyed | (see below) |

### The protocol

Hook input is a JSON object piped to the command's stdin. Beyond exit codes, a command hook may print a JSON response envelope on stdout:

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `continue: false` + `stopReason` | halt the turn |
| `systemMessage` | warn the user |
| `suppressOutput` | keep the output out of the display |
| `async: true` + `asyncTimeout` | run without blocking |

Any other nonzero exit shows stderr to **you** only, not the model.

Matchers alternate on tool name and can match arguments: `bash|edit`, `bash(git *)`, `write(*.md)`. An empty or missing matcher matches every tool. Unknown event names load with a warning rather than failing.

The worktree events are different in kind from the rest: configuring `WorktreeCreate` **replaces** git as plank's worktree backend rather than adding to it, which is how a non-git VCS can be driven. The hook is given the requested name and must print the resulting directory on stdout; `WorktreeRemove` is given a path to destroy. If you configure the first without the second, plank will refuse to remove what it cannot remove rather than guessing.

A hook can also be `{"type": "prompt", "prompt": "…"}` — static text injected to the model instead of a command to run.

`/hooks` shows what is configured.

## MCP servers

plank loads external tools from stdio and Streamable HTTP MCP servers. `~/.plank/.mcp.json` applies globally; `./.mcp.json` (or `--mcp-config FILE`) overrides same-named servers and adds new ones.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "demo": {
      "command": "some-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--flag"],
      "env": {"KEY": "value"},
      "primaryTools": ["tool_a"]
    },
    "remote": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:6510/mcp",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}
    }
  }
}
```

A `command` entry is spawned as a stdio subprocess; a `url` entry is reached over Streamable HTTP, with optional `headers` for auth.

Tools reach the model as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. **`primaryTools` controls prompt size**: listed tools get their full schema in the system prompt, everything else appears in a compact directory and is described on demand via the built-in `mcp_describe` tool. Omit the key and every tool is primary — fine for a small server, expensive for a large one.

Servers can also publish **resources**, which the model reads with `mcp_list_resources` and `mcp_read_resource`.

Once a server is connected you just ask for what it does — you do not name its tools:

```
what's the code health score as reported by tokensave?
what was my last published article on medium?
```

`/mcp` shows connected servers and their tools. A server that misses the response deadline is dropped along with all of its tools, so check `mcp.timeoutSecs` if one is slow to start.

### Reading images with ocr-mcp

plank can attach a screenshot, but the ds4 engine is text-only, so the model receives a path rather than pixels. [`ocr-mcp`](https://github.com/aovestdipaperino/ocr-mcp) closes that gap: it is a small MCP server that runs a local GLM-OCR model and exposes one tool, `transcribe_image`. Paste a screenshot of a stack trace, ask what it says, and the model calls the tool on the path and reads the answer back. Nothing leaves the machine and there is no API key.

Install it, along with the `llama-server` binary that does the inference:

```sh
brew install llama.cpp
cargo install ocr-mcp
```

Then register it like any other server, in `~/.plank/.mcp.json` to have it everywhere or `./.mcp.json` for one project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ocr": {
      "command": "ocr-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OCR_MCP_MODEL_DIR": "~/.cache/ocr-mcp",
        "OCR_MCP_AUTO_DOWNLOAD": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Getting the weights.** Two files are needed, the model and its matching projector, about 1.34 GiB together. With `OCR_MCP_AUTO_DOWNLOAD` set they are fetched the first time you actually ask for a transcription, not at startup, so plank's handshake is never held up and only that first call is slow. Leave the variable out and nothing is ever downloaded: the first transcription instead returns an error naming the two files and where they go. To fetch them by hand:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.cache/ocr-mcp && cd ~/.cache/ocr-mcp
BASE=https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/GLM-OCR-GGUF/resolve/main
curl -L "$BASE/GLM-OCR-Q8_0.gguf"        -o glm-ocr.gguf
curl -L "$BASE/mmproj-GLM-OCR-Q8_0.gguf" -o glm-ocr-mmproj.gguf
```

The server spawns `llama-server` on the first call, keeps it warm, and kills it after five idle minutes so the memory goes back to ds4. That last part is not incidental on a machine where ds4 already occupies 81 GB: set `OCR_MCP_IDLE_SECS` lower if you want the window shorter.

It is an OCR model, not a general vision model. It reads text well and it will answer confidently and wrongly if you ask it whether a user interface looks right. `/mcp` will show it connected once plank restarts.

### When a global server fails to start

plank does **not** simply drop it from the prompt. A global server's tool schemas are part of the cached system prompt, so losing one would change that prompt and force the most expensive possible reload. Instead plank substitutes the server's **last-known-good advertisement** from `~/.plank/mcp-advert/`, keeping the prompt byte-identical and the cache valid.

The consequence to know about: after a failed start, the model still believes those tools exist, and calls to them fail at dispatch rather than being avoided. If a server's tools are erroring in a way that makes no sense, check `~/.plank/errors.log` for a line about a substituted advertisement.

This applies to global servers only. Project-local servers are cheap to rebuild, so they get no cached record — a dead project server simply is not advertised.

## Plugins

A plugin is a directory that bundles several of the extension points above and contributes them to a session as one unit, instead of asking you to drop a skill here, an agent there and a hook file somewhere else.

```
my-plugin/
  .plank-plugin/plugin.json     name, description, version, author
  skills/release/SKILL.md
  agents/reviewer.md
  templates/review.md
  hooks.json
  .mcp.json
  settings.json
```

Every part is optional; a directory with a manifest and one component is a plugin. Both spellings are accepted, plank's and Claude Code's: the manifest may be `.plank-plugin/plugin.json` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, templates may live in `templates/` or `commands/`, hooks in `hooks.json` or `hooks/hooks.json`. Where both are present the plank spelling wins and the shadowing is reported. A directory with no manifest at all but with recognizable components still loads, named after the directory it sits in.

### Activating one

Plugins are loaded from three places, in order: `~/.plank/plugins/dev/*` for ones you want everywhere, `<cwd>/.plank/plugins/*` for ones that belong to a project, and each `--plugin-dir <path>` on the command line, which is repeatable and lasts only for that session. A later source shadows an earlier plugin of the same name, so a `--plugin-dir` copy is the natural way to try a change to a plugin you already have installed.

`/plugins` lists what loaded, where each one came from, what it contributes, and every warning raised along the way. Nothing about a bad plugin is fatal: a broken manifest or an unreadable component demotes that one plugin, or just that one component, and the session continues.

### Naming

One rule covers skills, agents and templates: a plugin contribution is always addressable as `<plugin>:<name>`, and it keeps the bare `<name>` only when nothing else claims it. Your own skills and agents always win the bare name, and when two plugins offer the same name neither keeps it — both stay reachable only in their namespaced form. `/skills`, `/agent` and `/templates` show the contributing plugin beside each entry.

MCP servers are the exception: the separator is `-`, so a disambiguated server is `<plugin>-<server>`. Server names are embedded in the tool name `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and split at the first `__`, which is also why a plugin server name containing `__` is rejected outright.

Hooks have no names to collide, so they are simply additive and all of them run: `~/.plank/hooks.json` first, then each plugin's hook file in load order, then the project's `./.plank/hooks.json`.

### Where plugin settings sit

A plugin's `settings.json` becomes a new precedence level directly above the built-in defaults, and below everything of yours:

```
defaults < plugin < ~/.plank/settings.json < ./.plank/settings.json < env < CLI
```

Several plugins merge in load order, later winning. By construction a plugin can never override a setting you set yourself. The sharp edge is the key you did *not* set: a plugin that writes a `safety.*` key still beats the built-in default, so a plugin can, for instance, turn the bash sandbox off if you have never set it explicitly. plank warns at startup and in `/plugins` whenever a plugin's settings touch a `safety.*` key — that warning is worth reading. See [Configuration](08-configuration.md).

### What is not here yet

This release makes hand-placed plugin directories work, and nothing more. There is no installer, no marketplace, no dependency resolution, no version handling and no policy controls. You place a plugin directory yourself, or pass it with `--plugin-dir`. Manifest fields that later work will need are tolerated and ignored today.
