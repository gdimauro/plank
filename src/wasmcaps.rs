//! Capability host functions: what a WASM component can do to the outside
//! world (`docs/WASM-PLUGINS.md`, "Capabilities").
//!
//! Three are implemented so far — `log`, `print` and `state` — chosen because
//! none of them needs a trust story beyond the one the registry already has.
//! `fs`, `net` and `exec` are the ones that undo the sandbox and are not wired.
//!
//! Everything here is compiled unconditionally and none of it mentions the
//! runtime. That is deliberate: the interesting parts — whether a grant is
//! honored, where a key is allowed to write, what a rejected call says — are
//! pure functions over a directory, and they are worth testing without a
//! wasm32 toolchain in the loop. The Extism glue that exposes them to a guest
//! lives in [`crate::wasmhost`] and is a thin shell over this.
//!
//! ## Why a grant is checked at call time
//!
//! Extism resolves a guest's imports at instantiation, so a component
//! importing a function plank does not provide fails to *load* with a message
//! about a missing import. That is a true statement about the module and a
//! useless one for a user, who asked why their plugin stopped working. Every
//! host function is therefore always provided, and each checks its own grant
//! when called — so the answer is "this component was not granted `print`",
//! naming the grant the user can actually give it.
