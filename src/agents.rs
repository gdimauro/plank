//! Single-subagent sidechain support (issue #10, reduced scope).
//!
//! `/subagent <task>` (or `/subagent:<name> <task>` for a named definition)
//! runs a delegated task as a *fork* of the current
//! conversation: the framed task is appended to the live transcript, the
//! normal turn loop runs (tools included), and afterwards the fork is
//! truncated so only the subagent's final report — framed by
//! [`report_message`] — enters the parent conversation. Because the fork
//! shares the parent transcript prefix, the engine's per-turn common-prefix
//! sync reuses the parent KV cache on the way in and rolls the sidechain
//! back on the next real turn.
//!
//! One built-in general-purpose subagent, plus *named* agent definitions
//! loaded from `~/.plank/agents/*.md` overlaid by `./.plank/agents/*.md`
//! (issue #19). A named definition supplies extra instructions that frame the
//! subagent's turn. Parallel/team orchestration remains out of scope (blocked
//! on per-session KV save/restore; see the tracking issue).
