//! When no `-m` is given, plank looks for `~/.plank/ds4flash.gguf`. If it is
//! missing, it offers to fetch the `DeepSeek` V4 Flash GGUF from Hugging Face
//! (`huggingface.co`),
//! streaming a magenta progress bar with a rotating series of messages.

//! The download runs for hours, so the screen hosts a playable round of

//! never delays the transfer, Esc puts it away, and `q` or Ctrl-C abort the
//! download from anywhere, so a rally can never trap the user.
