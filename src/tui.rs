//! Ratatui-based full-screen interactive UI.
//!
//! Uses the alternate screen buffer so every terminal — including block-based
//! ones like Warp that reflow normal output — treats plank as a proper TUI and
//! renders it cleanly. Replaces the hand-rolled raw-mode editor, scroll
//! regions, and in-place redraws.
//!
//! This module holds the presentational pieces: the styled scrollback log and
//! the per-frame layout. The interactive event loop lives in [`crate::ui`].
