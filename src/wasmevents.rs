//! The event bus WASM components observe (`docs/WASM-PLUGINS.md`, "Events").
//!
//! A component subscribes in its manifest and plank calls it only for what it
//! subscribed to, so an unsubscribed event costs nothing — no call, no
//! serialization, no fuel.
//!
//! ## One export, not one per event
//!
//! The design sketches a handler per event. This implements a single
//! `on_event` export that receives the event name alongside its payload, for
//! two reasons. Extism cannot type-check an export signature, so N exports buy
//! no safety over one — the ABI handshake is what catches drift either way.
//! And a new event would otherwise mean every component that wants it grows an
//! export, where the payload-evolution rule says additions must not disturb
//! existing components. The cost is that a guest writes its own `match` on the
//! event name; the Rust PDK makes that four lines.
//!
//! ## Classes
//!
//! An event's *class* is what its return value means, and it is a property of
//! the event, not of the subscriber:
//!
//! - **Notify** — the reply is ignored. The component is being told.
//! - **Veto** — the component may block the action, and the reason goes to
//!   whoever the action belonged to (the model, for tool events).
//! - **Transform** — the component may replace the payload, and replacements
//!   chain through subscribers in load order, so the second subscriber sees
//!   what the first produced.
//!
//! A component that answers outside its event's class is ignored rather than
//! corrected: a `block` on a notify event is not a reason to fail a turn.
