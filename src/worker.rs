//! Worker/UI split for the TUI (issue #12), mirroring the C's "Model Worker
//! Thread" and "Worker/UI Synchronization Helpers" sections.
//!
//! During a turn the engine, session, and tool dispatch run on a scoped
//! worker thread while the UI thread keeps its real event loop: the next
//! prompt stays editable (and is queued for the worker to drain between tool
//! rounds, like the C's `queued_user_drain`), scrolling and interrupts work
//! directly, and redraws happen at the UI's own cadence instead of inside an
//! engine callback.
//!
//! The channel payload is [`UiEvent`]: the [`crate::viz::RenderSink`] calls
//! made by the worker's stream renderer, plus log lines and status snapshots.
//! [`RenderSink`] is the natural serialization boundary — the UI replays the
//! same calls against the real [`crate::tui::OutputLog`].
