//! Context compaction: reclaim context in escalating steps.
//!
//! Cheapest first: **microcompact** clears the bodies of old tool results
//! (keeping the newest few) without any model round-trip. When that is not
//! enough, full compaction asks the model for durable task state and rebuilds
//! the live transcript as: system prompt + summary + recent verbatim tail +
//! a budgeted re-injection of recently read files. Port of the "Context
//! Compaction" section of `ds4_agent.c`, adapted from token transcripts to
//! text messages, with the layered strategy from the reference agent.
