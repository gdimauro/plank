//! `/insights`: a personal usage report computed from saved sessions.
//!
//! Adapted from Claude Code's builtin of the same name (reverse-engineered
//! design notes in `local/INSIGHTS.md`), with its central discipline kept
//! intact: **every number in the report is computed deterministically in
//! code, and the model is used only for prose it cannot replace**. The two
//! halves never mix — a failed or skipped model call costs the report its
//! narrative, never its statistics.
//!
//! The reference also asks the model to judge each session individually
//! ("facets": inferred goal, satisfaction, friction). plank does not: facet
//! extraction is one model call per session, and against a local engine over
//! a few hundred saved sessions that is minutes of compute for a paragraph of
//! prose. Instead the per-session pass is fully deterministic and the model
//! sees only the finished aggregate, which costs a fixed handful of calls no
//! matter how much history has accumulated.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! 1. **Scan** every session in the store (`SessionStore::list`), cheaply —
//!    listing metadata only, no transcript parsing.
//! 2. **Per-session stats** ([`SessionMeta`]): served from
//!    `~/.plank/usage-data/session-meta/<id>.json` when the cache entry still
//!    matches the file's size and mtime, otherwise computed by parsing the
//!    transcript and written back. Unlike the reference, whose transcripts are
//!    append-only per session, plank rewrites a session file in place on every
//!    save — so the cache is keyed by id *and validated against the file's
//!    size and mtime*, not by id alone.
//! 3. **Filter** sessions that are too slight to say anything about (fewer
//!    than [`MIN_HUMAN_MESSAGES`] human turns).
//! 4. **Aggregate** ([`Aggregated`]): totals, histograms, response-time
//!    percentiles, activity by hour, and overlapping-session detection.
//! 5. **Narrative** ([`Narrative`]): a fixed number of engine calls over the
//!    aggregate JSON, each demanding one JSON object, each independently
//!    droppable on failure.
//! 6. **Render**: a self-contained HTML report plus a condensed summary for
//!    the terminal.
//!
//! # What the transcript can and cannot say
//!
//! plank stores a session as flat role-tagged text, so the statistics are
//! recovered by re-parsing it: tool calls come from the DSML stanzas in
//! assistant turns (via [`crate::export::segments`], the same parse the HTML
//! export uses), and tool outcomes from the `Tool result N (name):` framing
//! [`crate::tools::dispatch_all`] writes, where a failure is any payload
//! beginning `Tool error:` and a failed shell is a non-zero `exit_status=`.
//!
//! Timestamps are the one thing no amount of parsing recovers: per-message
//! stamps were added to the session format for this feature, so response
//! times, activity by hour, and overlap detection exist only for sessions
//! recorded since. Sessions older than that still contribute every other
//! statistic; the report says how many of them there were rather than
//! quietly averaging over a smaller set.
