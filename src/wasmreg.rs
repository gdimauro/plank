//! WASM component discovery, trust and registry (`docs/WASM-PLUGINS.md`,
//! Phase 1).
//!
//! A WASM component is not a plugin of its own: it is one more **component
//! kind** inside the plugin directories [`crate::plugins`] already loads,
//! alongside skills, agents, templates, hooks and MCP servers. That decision
//! is recorded in the design doc; the consequence here is that this module
//! never scans the filesystem for plugins. It is handed a loaded
//! [`crate::plugins::PluginSet`] and looks *inside* it.
//!
//! Everything in this module is compiled unconditionally, with no dependency
//! on the `plugins` feature. Discovery, manifest parsing and trust are pure
//! logic and are worth testing in the default build; only *running* a module
//! needs the runtime, and that goes through [`crate::wasmhost::WasmHost`],
//! whose no-op refuses cleanly. A build without the feature therefore still
//! lists what is installed and still explains why it is not running.
//!
//! ## Trust, and why project-local is the sharp edge
//!
//! Sandboxing is the containment story; trust is the provenance one. The rule
//! is that a component's SHA-256 **is** its identity — the same discipline
//! `session.rs` applies to KV blobs — so changed bytes are a different
//! component and re-prompt, and a capability set that grows re-prompts even
//! when the bytes are known.
//!
//! Project-local components (`./.plank/plugins/`) are default-deny, while
//! project-local *skills* are not. That asymmetry is deliberate and is the one
//! thing in this module most likely to look like a bug: cloning a repo already
//! activates its skills and MCP servers, which is tolerable, and would activate
//! a `.wasm` holding `exec`, which is not. The question trust answers is what
//! the code can reach, not where its directory sits.
