//! Agent session persistence, listing, and history rendering.
//!
//! Port of the ds4 agent sections "Agent KV Store And Session Persistence"
//! and "Session Listing, History Rendering, And Completion". The C agent
//! persists engine KV state plus a rendered token transcript in one file;
//! plank persists the text transcript as the session file and keeps the
//! engine KV state in a fingerprinted `<name>.kv_raw` sidecar (a
//! [`crate::kvcache::KVCache`] keyed by [`KvKey::Session`]), while keeping the
//! same user-visible behavior: sessions
//! live under `~/.plank/kvcache` as `<name>.kv` files. A session id is a
//! memorable `adjective-celebrity` name minted on first save (e.g.
//! `deadly-einstein`), disambiguated with a short guid on the rare filename
//! collision; legacy `<40-hex>.kv` files from earlier versions still load and
//! list, and older payload-less sessions load fine (the sidecar is a pure
//! cache). Titles derive from the first user prompt, listings sort most recent
//! first, and history replay uses the exact `User:` / `Assistant:` /
//! `Tool result:` headers of the C agent.
//!
//! # On-disk format
//!
//! A session file is line-oriented UTF-8 with length-prefixed bodies:
//!
//! ```text
//! plank-session 1
//! created <unix-seconds>
//! used <unix-seconds>
//! title <byte-len>
//! <title bytes>
//! msg <user|assistant> <byte-len> [<unix-seconds>]
//! <message bytes>
//! ...
//! node <id> <parent-id|-> <user|assistant> <byte-len> [<unix-seconds>]
//! <message bytes>
//! ...
//! cwd <byte-len>
//! <project directory bytes>
//! meta <tag-byte-len> <last-prompt-byte-len>
//! <tag bytes>
//! <last prompt bytes>
//! ```
//!
//! Length prefixes make message bodies unambiguous regardless of content.
//! The trailing `meta` record duplicates listing metadata (tag, clipped last
//! user prompt) at the end of the file so `list()` can read it with a
//! bounded tail read instead of parsing the whole transcript; files written
//! before it existed simply lack the record.
//!
//! The trailing timestamp on a `msg`/`node` record is the wall-clock second
//! the message was appended, added for `/insights` (response times, activity
//! by hour, overlapping-session detection). It is optional in both directions:
//! records written before it existed parse with a zero timestamp, and a
//! message with a zero timestamp is written without the field, so a session
//! that never carried stamps stays byte-identical. The `cwd` record is the
//! same kind of optional addition, recording the project directory the session
//! ran in (which the transcript itself does not state).
//!
//! The `msg` records are the session tree's *active branch*; the optional
//! `node` records describe the off-path branches left by `/fork` and `/clone`
//! (issue #65), numbering the active branch `0..n` and continuing from there.
//! A linear session writes no `node` records at all, and a file without them
//! loads as a single-branch tree — that is what keeps every pre-branching
//! session readable.
