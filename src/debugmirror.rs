//! Mirrors the raw model stream to `turbo-debug-console`, an external Turbo
//! Vision window, whenever `ui.showThinking` is off.
//!
//! The console is optional infrastructure a developer may or may not have
//! running: nothing here may ever block a turn, panic, or spam retries. The
//! design is deliberately dumb:
//!
//! - A registry of connections keyed by [`MirrorId`], with
//!   [`MirrorId::PARENT`] for the session's own window and one entry per live
//!   sub-agent. Which one [`push`] writes to is a thread-local, defaulting to
//!   the parent, so code that knows nothing about sub-agents is unaffected.
//!   Sub-agents need this because a fan-out generates several at once
//!   (`generate_fanout_round` spawns a thread per slot) and each wants its own
//!   named window: `plank:<session>:subagent-<ordinal>`, ordinal monotonic
//!   within a session and reset when the session changes.
//! - [`reconcile`] is the only thing that ever dials out, and it makes at most
//!   one connection attempt per call — never a retry loop. It is called (a)
//!   whenever the settings are swapped in (`settings::install`/`reinstall`),
//!   which is the "immediately" of the showThinking toggle, and (b)
//!   defensively at the start of each turn, which is where a console that
//!   started up *after* plank gets picked up, without plank needing a
//!   restart. Neither call site is a hot path: turns start far less often
//!   than tokens stream.
//! - [`push`] never retries. A write failure (console closed mid-generation)
//!   just drops the connection so the rest of the turn streams normally; the
//!   next reconcile (next turn, or the next settings change) will try again.
//!
//! What gets mirrored is the *whole* raw model stream — thinking, visible
//! answer, tool-call markup, byte for byte — because the console runs its own
//! copy of `trace-stream` and renders it exactly as plank would. Filtering to
//! "just the thinking" would leave the console unable to reproduce plank's
//! own rendering, which is the entire point of pointing it at the raw bytes.
