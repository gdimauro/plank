# Builds the WASM guests. Requires the wasm32-unknown-unknown target
# (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`). The host tests that consume
# these artifacts skip when they are absent, so this is never on the critical
# path of a normal build or of CI's default job.
#
# `screensavers` and `arcades` are separate plugins, not one artifact with a
# flag: they are separate things, and a user should be able to install ambient
# faces without installing games.
