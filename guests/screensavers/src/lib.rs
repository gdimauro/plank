//! Screensaver faces, as one WASM component.
//!
//! A screensaver plugin declares `"kind": "screensaver"`, which is what puts
//! it in the idle rotation beside the faces plank ships. It is a different
//! plugin from the arcade on purpose: the two want opposite behaviour — a
//! screensaver appears unasked and any key dismisses it, a game is started
//! deliberately and keeps its keys — and a user who wants ambient faces and no
//! games should be able to install exactly that.
//!
//! **plank's own matrix rain is not here.** It stays in the binary, because it
//! is the *default* screensaver: a plank with no plugins installed still has
//! one, and a default that depends on a plugin is not a default. The same goes
//! for breakout, which the download screen draws.
